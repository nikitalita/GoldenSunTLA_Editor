v0.0.2a (Feb 23, 2013)

*Map Editor: Started coding the World Map Viewer (NOT WORKING YET!)
*Map Editor: Tile Scripts on tilemap now display on map. **Using surfaces method only.**
*Map Editor: Placed a tileset box next to the map editor for future map editing purposes.
*Map Editor: You can now edit 16x16 tiles, but not 8x8 tiles. It's currently very slow.

Minor stuff:
*Map Editor: Added Code file deletion for when you leave this section.
*Map Editor: Keyboard support for layer toggling. (Might come in handy if the controls are put in a menu.)
*Map Editor: Fixed display of scrollbar in NPC Event's box.
*Enemy Editor: The Sequential 

Thanks to Salanewt for the following:

*Ability Editor: Added "types" combobox button
*Fixed up the ability effects list to clarify on a few things


Known problems:
Golden Sun 1:
-Sol Sanctum (Map 16) has layers not aligned properly.
-Alpine Crossing (Map 74) shows incorrect graphic tiles. Needs upgrading to animated tiles.

Changes to language.ini: item_transfer, item_f5_gs1, item_f5_gs2
See obj_eItems: End Step (1st script), User Defined 2

*Class Editor: Replaced unknowns with Vulnerabilities!

Maps like GS1's Alpine Crossing (74) are not fixed, and are most likely done via animated tiles.
